                        White Box Testing Examples

White box testing, also known as clear box testing or glass box testing, is a software testing technique where the tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the software, including its code and architecture.

Example 1: Testing a Simple Calculator
Suppose we have a simple calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We want to test the addition function.
public int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
White box testing would involve testing the following scenarios:
 Test if the function returns the correct result for positive numbers (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5)
 Test if the function returns the correct result for negative numbers (e.g., -2 + (-3) = -5)
 Test if the function returns the correct result for zero (e.g., 0 + 0 = 0)
 Test if the function handles integer overflow (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1)


Example 2: Testing a Login System
Suppose we have a login system that checks the username and password.
public boolean login(String username, String password) {
  if (username.equals("admin") && password.equals("password")) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
White box testing would involve testing the following scenarios:
 Test if the function returns true for the correct username and password
 Test if the function returns false for an incorrect username
 Test if the function returns false for an incorrect password
 Test if the function handles null or empty inputs

Example 3: Testing a Bank Account System
Suppose we have a bank account system that allows deposits and withdrawals.
public void deposit(double amount) {
  balance += amount;
}
public void withdraw(double amount) {
  if (balance >= amount) {
    balance -= amount;
  } else {
    throw new InsufficientFundsException();
  }
}
White box testing would involve testing the following scenarios:
 Test if the deposit function correctly updates the balance
 Test if the withdraw function correctly updates the balance
 Test if the withdraw function throws an exception for insufficient funds
 Test if the functions handle negative or zero amounts
